# Welcome to Boop Park

## Overview

**Hoops Park** is a great little public park in Aurora, Colorado. After many visits to play ball and train, I got the idea to create various workouts that anyone could do, anywhere. For instance at a public basketball court...

The name **Boop Park** simply comes from the first time I told a roommate about Hoops Park, they misheard what I said and it has been referred to as _Boop_ Park ever since.

## Beta Version

Boop Park is currently in Beta version. This means essential features like user profiles, security, accessibility, and community involvement and feedback, are still being worked on.

How does it affect you? Mostly it doesn't. Boop Park is generated using popular, documented, secured, and supported production-ready open-source components & packages so you know it is ready to use. I mostly wanted to make the tools and project available as soon as possible for anyone who will benefit from them.
