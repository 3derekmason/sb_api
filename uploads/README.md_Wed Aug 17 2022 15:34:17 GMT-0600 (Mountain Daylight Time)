## **Are you indispensable?**

### _How do you become indispensable? What does that even mean?_

> <br>

## Part One: _give your work your all and be indispensable_

> Your résumé sits in a stack next to plenty of other résumés, each striving to fit in and meet the requirements. Your cubicle is next to the other cubes, each like the other. Your business card and suit and approach to problems—all designed to fit in.

A linchpin doesn’t just fit in. Of course there are still dances we will have to do to please people sometimes, but the real opportunity to be indispensable comes after you’ve gotten the job…

### _You are not your resume, you are your work._

> A Linchpin is enlightened enough to see the world as it is, to understand that this angry customer is not about me, that this change in government policy is not a personal attack, that this job is not guaranteed for life.

At the same time, the linchpin **brings passion to the job**. They know that the right effort in the right place can change the outcome, and they reserve their effort for doing just that...

### Two interesting personality traits present in Linchpin, both equally important:

1. The first kind _**never says “no”**_, because they always manage to find a way to make things happen, and they do it. It’s done.

2. The second kind _**always says “no”**_! They say no because they have goals, because theyre a practical visionary, because they understand priorities.<br>
   They say no because they have the strength to disappoint you now in order to delight you later.

We all fill out our resumes and add them to the massive pile... But that’s just the system we’ve come into. We are unfortunately born into the _**easy**_ routine, it takes some effort to break out.

The sign in front of your public school could say:

> "We train the factory workers of tomorrow. Our graduates are very good at following instructions. And we teach the power of consumption as an aid for social approval."

Basically we are really, really good at creating _**average**_...

## Part Two: _Fear, Resistance, and the Lizard Brain_

### So where does _average_ come from?

We have essentially been brainwashed by school and by "the system" into believing that our job is to do our job and follow instructions.

> How many of your coworkers spend all day in search of perfect? Or, more accurately, spend all day trying to avoid making a mistake?

Everyone has a little voice inside of their head that’s angry and afraid.

The "Lizard Brain", the resistance.

The Lizard Brain wants to keep you **safe**. This means however, that Lizard Brain will do everything to keep us from _ANY_ situation in which we may not be perfectly safe...

> The only way linchpins differ from a mediocre rule-follower is that they never bought into this self-limiting line of thought.

<br><br>

### _Lizard Brain is incredibly anxious..._

Anxiety is practicing fears in advance.

Anxiety is needless and imaginary. It’s fear about fear, fear that means nothing.

_The difference between fear and anxiety:_ Anxiety is diffuse and focuses on possibilities in an unknown future, not a real and present threat.

The resistance is everywhere, all the time.

Its goal is to make you safe, which means _invisible and unchanged_.

Visibility is dangerous.

It leads to the possibility of people laughing at you, or even death. Change is dangerous because it involves moving from the known to the unknown, and that might be dangerous...

Often times, the resistance will help you find the thing you most need to do because it is **the thing the resistance most wants to stop**.

<br>

As we seek to become indispensable, a question worth asking:

### “Where do you put the fear?”

What separates a linchpin from an ordinary person is the answer to this question. Most of us feel fear and react to it. The linchpin feels that fear, acknowledges it, then proceeds.

<br>

## Part Three: _Give gifts_

> The discipline of shipping is essential in the long-term path to becoming indispensable.

But shipping our product isnt the only way to give gifts.

### Emotional Labor vs Physical Labor

**Art** involves labor. Not the labor of lifting a brush or typing a sentence, but the emotional labor of doing something difficult, taking a risk and extending yourself.

### _We give our art, whatever it may be._

What gifts can you give as a jr dev? What gifts can you bring to seemingly everyday situations?

<br>

## In Summary:

### Probably the most guaranteed way to become a successful linchpin is to build a support team of fellow linchpins.

Like minds that push and challenge each other to grow in new and undiscovered areas.

When someone says to you, “I don’t have any good ideas . . . I’m just not good at that,”...
ask them, _**“Do you have any bad ideas?”**_

<br>

Successful people are successful for one simple reason: they think about failure differently.

Successful people learn from failure, but they don’t learn that they shouldn’t have tried in the first place, and they don’t learn that they are always right and the world is wrong and they don’t learn that they are losers. They learn that the tactics they used didn’t work or that the person they used them on didn’t respond.

If you can be **human** at work (not a machine), you’ll discover a passion for work you didn’t know had.

No one is made for _ANY_ job. We make ourselves good at a job.

A linchpin to me is someone who understands this and accepts it as an exciting challenge.
