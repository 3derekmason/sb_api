# Practicing Autoregulation

## _What is autoregulation?_

As humans, we often have a tendency to push ourselves to some extreme limits when we really want to make something happen. On the other hand, we also have a tendency to sometimes slow down and go through the motions of something we don’t necessarily want to do.

It can be difficult to find the sweet spot between working to exhaustion and not quite working to one’s potential.

The practice of finding this balance is _autoregulation_. Training our body and mind into a natural and **most beneficial state**.

When I was a personal trainer, I had the opportunity to work with and learn from individuals each with their own strengths as well as personal struggles.

Believe it or not, my approach to training each of these people needed to be different and unique in order to really help them achieve their goals.

> Autoregulation is simply a systematic approach to implementing individuality.

Autoregulation is something we can practice ourselves, and teach others at the same time. It is very important to remember, however, that your experience and knowledge will sometimes surpass that of your clients / coworkers.

Sometimes it can be very easy to assume someone else _“gets it”_ because you’ve worked on something and have it internalized or perfected.

It is also often very tempting to not follow your own rules and push through something you might never recommend to another.

I’ve personally fallen into both of these traps _countless_ times. At the end of the day autoregulation comes down to our **struggle to tame our own ego**.

In the world of fitness a common indicator used is the Rate of Perceived Exertion scale. When training a client or myself, it is very common to refer to this chart to progress through a workout.

But is this really the best, healthiest standard to follow?
I believe that doing something well is always about doing it properly.

If you follow a training program that pushes you to the max in order to improve as quickly as you can, it sets up an unsustainable lifestyle that more than likely will lead to burnout or injury.

The same can be said for the workplace. If you constantly push yourself to learn the newest technologies to never be out of the loop, or spend countless hours at once on a single task the burnout can lead to a lack of motivation and enjoyment essential to productivity.

### So what I’m saying is that we should just do whatever we feel like and not do things that are too hard, right?

Not exactly… This can be a common view for someone who refutes the benefits of autoregulation. But this is one reason it takes constant practice to get to the state in which we benefit the most.
As I mentioned before, learning when to go and when to stop can be a tricky balance.

When I go into a training session, how I or a client feel that day should never be an indicator of how the workout will go. However, I also never go into a session with a completely scaffolded plan of what I will do that day.

The difference when practicing autoregulation is listening to your _mood_ or the _voice in your head_ vs the _quality of your actual performance_. This is the difference between doing whatever you feel like and staying on track to progress and meet your goals.

### No pain no gain? Listen to your gut.

If I go into a workout thinking _“I’m gonna pull X pounds X times and it’s going to be so awesome”_, it can be super hard to begin working up to X and realize that something is bothered that day and I probably shouldn’t still try to pull X pounds X times today because I may then be out of training for X extra days...

So how do we really do this and apply autoregulation in everyday life? **Practicing awareness is a great place to start**.
Paying attention to your body and the quality of physical and mental performance in anything you’re doing makes it easier and easier to find that sweet spot of progression and accomplishment.

A lot easier said than done, right?… _So practice!_ Teach yourself, teach those around you _(while staying aware of the curse of your own knowledge)_, and recognize the **individuality** and **uniqueness** of every person and experience.
